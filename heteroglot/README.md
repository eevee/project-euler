This is a set of Project Euler solutions in which no programming language is
used twice.

Each program begins with a comment containing the entire problem description.
When run, each program prints the solution and a single newline to standard
output.  There are no Makefiles or other compilation aids here; with very few
exceptions, solutions should only require a single source file.


# Rules

The rules are loose and entirely subject to my interpretation, but I try to
stick to the following:

* Languages may not be reused.  Variants are generally avoided, but the
  ultimate guideline is whether the result would be _interesting_.

* Languages shall be chosen without regard for the requirements of the next
  problem.  Ideally, I should have no idea what the next problem even is.

* Trivial transformational scripts (in any language) are allowed in extreme
  cases if a language is particularly difficult to read or write.  This
  exception exists solely for Whitespace.

* Programs must perform the actual calculation.  The general pattern is that
  any numbers or other parameters that appear in the problem are defined as
  constants within the program; changing the constants thus ought to produce
  the appropriate answer.  (Programs are not, however, expected to deal with
  excessively large or malformed parameters.)


# Unusables

For reference, the following languages have been attempted, but have been ruled
_unusable_ by executive decision.

* Malbolge
