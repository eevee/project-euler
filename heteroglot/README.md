This is a set of Project Euler solutions in which no programming language is
used twice.

Each program begins with a comment containing the entire problem description.
When run, each program prints the solution and a single newline to standard
output.  There are no Makefiles or other compilation aids here; with very few
exceptions, solutions should only require a single source file.


# Rules

The rules are loose and entirely subject to my interpretation, but I try to
stick to the following:

* Languages may not be reused.  Variants are generally avoided, but the
  ultimate guideline is whether the result would be _interesting_.

* Languages shall be chosen without regard for the requirements of the next
  problem.  Ideally, I should have no idea what the next problem even is.

* Trivial transformational scripts (in any language) are allowed in extreme
  cases if a language is particularly difficult to read or write.  This
  exception exists solely for Whitespace.

* Programs must perform the actual calculation.  The general pattern is that
  any numbers or other parameters that appear in the problem are defined as
  constants within the program; changing the constants thus ought to produce
  the appropriate answer.  (Programs are not, however, expected to deal with
  excessively large or malformed parameters.)

For posterity, the following languages have been attempted in the past, but
have been ruled _unusable_ by executive decree.

* Malbolge
