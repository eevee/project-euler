In this set of solutions, no programming language is used twice.  Variants are
generally avoided, unless they would prove to be interesting.  Trivial
transformational scripts (in any language) are allowed for generating source if
the language is particularly resilient to actual use, such as Whitespace.
Languages are selected more or less arbitrarily, without looking at the next
problem first.

Each program takes no input and prints the problem's answer to stdout followed
by a single newline.  Input data is contained within the source, to avoid any
problems with languages that lack decent input or parsing functionality out of
the box.  Source code also includes the problem description.

No makefiles, project files, etc. are included, as every program should only
need one source file and ought to be trivially compilable.
